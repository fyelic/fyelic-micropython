## Power Module Notes
- The positive and negative pins on the power module must match the power rails on the breadboard, and both sides need to fit snugly.
- Compatibility with 4 AA batteries connected to a power jack
- The power module makes it so you can run a file on the Pi Pico without a computer being attached to it
    - To do this, you need to save the file of choice as main.py to the Pi Pico (not to your computer)
- There are two connections on the power supply module that are adjustable. 
  Double-check that they are both set to 3.3 volts, as 5 volts will fry your Pi Pico.
- There is a button next to the power jack. This needs to be pressed down to run the program. The LED indicator on the module will turn on.
