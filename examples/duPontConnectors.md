# FYELIC DuPont Connector Covers
Our 3D Printed DuPont covers are great for organizing wires and ensuring a secure connection between male andfemale ends. 
Currently, there are 2, 4, 6, and 8-wire covers available at FYELIC. 
Talk to a Red Vest to check one out. \

If you need to cover an odd number of wires, you can size up and the wires will still stay secure.

### Steps for covering DuPont wires
1. Attach the male and female ends of the wires

3. Place the connected wires in the DuPont wire cover
4. Close the lid of the cover until you hear a "click"

That's it! Feel free to come to FYELIC to try one for yourself. 

**Keep in mind: there is a chance that the cover will break when you try to open it. If this happens, you can get a new one at FYELIC.**
